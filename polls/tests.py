# Create your tests here.

"""
A conventional place for an application’s tests is in the application’s tests.py file; 
the testing system will automatically find tests in any file whose name begins with test.

if the method name of the class does not start with test_, it will not be recognized as a test case by Django's test runner.

python manage.py test:
    Looks for all test classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase or django.test.TestCase.
    Finds all methods in those classes whose names start with test_.
    Executes those methods.

When running tests in Django, the test framework creates a temporary, isolated test database that is separate from your current development or production database.
Django applies all migrations to the test database to ensure the schema matches your actual database.
Any data you create during the tests (via fixtures or manually in the test code) exists only in the test database.
The database is reset for each test method, so the first question is no longer there, and so again the index shouldn’t have any questions in it.



The test database is created empty, except for:
    Tables created by migrations.
    Optional fixtures you load for testing.

After the tests complete, Django deletes the test database.

As long as your tests are sensibly arranged, they won’t become unmanageable. Good rules-of-thumb include having:
    a separate TestClass for each model or view
    a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
    test method names that describe their function
